  <p><img style="border:20px solid white;" src = "/images/Ben-image.jpeg" alt="Ben" height="600" width ="500" align = "right">
        I completed my PhD at Saarland University in 2008 and then moved to Princeton University for postdoctoral training (2007-2010).
        After the time in Princeton I spent two years as a research scientist at the Max-Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin 
          before taking the position of an assistant professor at the Psychology Department at TU Dresden. 
          Since August 2016 I am an associate professor in the Psychology Department at Concordia University and since June 2017 
          a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair (CRC) in cognitive neuroscience of healthy decision-making in human aging.<br>You can contact me at

        <p class="title">PhD Candidate in Clinical Psychology</p>
        <p>My doctoral research is centered around decision-making and memory function, including associative and reinforcement 
          learning across the lifespan. I am interested in the cognitive processes that are involved in encoding and recalling 
          information, and what factors support or hinder our abilities to learn new material. My previous research experience has focused 
          around memory, language, and cognitive function in healthy aging adults, adults with pre-clinical neurodegeneration, as well 
          as patients with temporal-lobe epilepsy. My main clinical interests are within neuropsychology in assessment, differential diagnosis, 
          and intervention. I have previous clinical training in neuropsychology, individual therapy, and am currently at the AMI in the 
          Sex and Couples Therapy Service practicum. </p>

        <h2>Alexa Ruel</h2>
        <p class="title">PhD Candidate in Experimental Psychology</p>
        <p>Broadly, I am interested in how we can model developmental changes in learning and decision-making strategies order to 
          better understand how school-aged children learn, and how we can support learning in and outside of the classroom. Specifically, 
          I am examining how the use of model-based, model-free and other intermediate decision strategies change across the lifespan. 
          To do so, I am using methods such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and computational modeling. When making decisions, itâ€™s also 
          important to have an accurate representation of the environment in which these decisions will take place. Thus, my second main 
          research interest is the developmental changes in the neural mechanisms supporting the creation and maintenance of the cognitive 
          maps of state spaces.</p>

        <p class="title">PhD Candidate in Clinical Psychology</p>
        <p>I am currently studying how problems with attention affect various neuro-cognitive processes including learning and decision-making 
          abilities. My clinical interests include neuropsychological assessment as well as individual psychotherapy in adult and older adult 
          populations with a variety of presenting problems including ADHD, neuro-cognitive, anxiety and major affective disorders.</p>

          <p class="title">MA Candidate in Experimental Psychology</p>
          <p>I am currently completing my Master's degree in the lab. My main research interests are cognitive effort and decision-making.
            On the one hand, I'm interested in exploring how the amount of work we put in to thinking about a decision affects its 
            outcome. On the other, I'm also interested in how differences in rewards for certain actions affect how we allocate cognitive 
            resources in the first place. Additionally, I'm interested in higher-order decision-making processes, like those involved in 
            moral and social decisions. My Master's thesis touches on this and explores how decisions about categories shift as we age.

        <p> I recently completed by Undergraduate degree at Concordia University. 
          <br> My research interests include how the ability to engage in cognitive control changes across the lifespan. More specifically, I'm
          interested in investigating the developmental and individual differences in effort-reward tradeoffs. I would like to study these basic 
          cognitive mechanisms on a neuobiological and computational level.
