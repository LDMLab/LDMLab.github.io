<strong>Effort-Reward Trade-Off</strong>
<img src='/images/time-reward-effort.jpg'>
<br>
<p>Every day life requires that we balance effort and reward. While some situations call for habitual response, others require us
to engage in goal-directed behaviour. Importantly, our ability and willingness to balance these different types of behaviour 
differs from person to person. In this project, we are interested in how individual differences affect how we balance the 
effort that people put into actions against the potential benefits they reap from performing these actions. </p>
