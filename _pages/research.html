        <h2>Lifespan developmental changes</h2>
        <p> The aim of this project is to study whether children and older adults differ from younger adults in how they update their beliefs in uncertain and changing environments. The goal is to develop mechanistic, 
          neurobiologically plausible theories of lifespan age differences in adaptive learning. The project involves collaborations with Rasmus Bruckner (FU Berlin) and Dr. Matthew Nassar (Brown University) and is 
          supported by the Canada Research Chair (CRC). </p>

        <h2>Prevalence-Induced Concept Change </h2>
        <p> In this research we explore how changes in oneâ€™s environment affect concept formation and judgements across the human lifespan. We are particularly interested in a phenomenon 
          called prevalence-induced concept change (PICC) which suggests that as the prevalence of instances of a concept in the environment changes, so do the boundaries of that concept. 
          In this project we collaborate with Dr. David Levari (Harvard University), Dr. Robert Wilson (University of Arizona) and Dr. Stefan Ehrlich, (TU Dresden) and is funded by the Canada 
          Research Chair (CRC).</p>
        <p> <b>News:</b> New <a href ="https://psyarxiv.com/uhcp7" target = "_blank">Preprint</a>: In this work we show evidence for a greater rigidity of concept spaces in older adults which 
          may make them less susceptible to biases in judgement. </p>

        <h2>Age differences in decision-making strategies </h2>
        <p> In this study we are interested in studying how young adults and old adults engage in 
          different decision-making strategies. Why do older adults rely more strongly on a habitual 
          decision-making strategy than younger adults do? What is the neural mechanism supporting this 
          shift towards habitual decision-making?</p>

        <h2>Cost benefit analysis in cognitive control across the lifespan</h2>
        <p> Every day life requires that we balance effort and reward. While some situations 
          call for habitual response, others require us to engage in goal-directed behaviour. 
          In this project, we are interested in how individual differences affect how we balance the effort 
          that people put into actions against the potential benefits they reap from performing these actions. </p>

        <h2>Lifespan age differences in metacontrol</h2>
        <p> Metacontrol is the ability to adapt decision-making strategies to varying demands. In this study, we investiagted 
          the development of metacontrol of decision-making. More specifically, we are interested in the effects of outcome 
          magnitude and valence on decision-making strategies and how this chnages across the lifespan.</p>

        <h2>Observational Learning </h2>
        <p> Learning from social information shapes our cognitive development. We are constantly learning from actions and outcomes of others. 
          In this study, we are interested in whether children and young adults differ in their ability to learn from observed feedback 
          and whether there are neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these differences.</p>
