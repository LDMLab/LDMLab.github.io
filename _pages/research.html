        <h2>Lifespan developmental changes</h2>
        <p> The aim of this project is to study whether children and older adults differ from younger adults in how they update their beliefs in uncertain and changing environments. The goal is to develop mechanistic, 
          neurobiologically plausible theories of lifespan age differences in adaptive learning. The project involves collaborations with Rasmus Bruckner (FU Berlin) and Dr. Matthew Nassar (Brown University) and is 
          supported by the Canada Research Chair (CRC). </p>

        <h2>Prevalence-Induced Concept Change </h2>
        <p> In this research we explore how changes in oneâ€™s environment affect concept formation and judgements across the human lifespan. We are particularly interested in a phenomenon 
          called prevalence-induced concept change (PICC) which suggests that as the prevalence of instances of a concept in the environment changes, so do the boundaries of that concept. 
          In this project we collaborate with Dr. David Levari (Harvard University), Dr. Robert Wilson (University of Arizona) and Dr. Stefan Ehrlich, (TU Dresden) and is funded by the Canada 
          Research Chair (CRC).</p>

        <h2>Age differences in learning and decision strategies</h2>
        <p> In this part of the research program we study how the use of different learning strategies changes across development. We are interested in why children and older adults tend to 
          converge on simpler learning strategies and which neural mechanisms underlie age differences in learning. The future goal of this research is to establish whether replay mechanisms 
          might support the adaptive use of different learning strategies. Collaboration partners: Dr. Andrea Reiter (UC London), Dr. S. Kiebel (TU Dresden) and Dr. Ida Momennejad (Columbia University). 
          The work is funded by the German Research Foundation (SFB 940).</p>

        <h2>Lifespan age differences in effort reward trade-offs</h2>
        <p> Everyday life requires that we balance the effort that we have to exert to reach a goal against the expected outcomes of the respective behavior. In this project, we are interested in how individuals of 
          different ages balance the relative costs and benefits of engaging in effortful behavior. We propose that effort expenditure in children and older adults depends on developmental sweet spots at which the 
          incentivization structure of the task and the task demands are tailored to the needs and cognitive abilities of the different age groups. This research involves collaborations with R. Otto (McGill University) 
          and Dr. Andrea Reiter (UC London) and is funded through NSERC and German Research Foundation (SFB 940). </p>

        <h2>Developmental changes in social learning</h2>
        <p> In this project we study how social information from others affects learning and decision behaviour in children and older adults. We are particularly interested in developmental changes in observational learning and in 
          the effects of social advice on decision preferences and learning performance. This work involves collaborations with Dr. J. Rodriguez-Buritica (FU Berlin), Prof. E. Crone (Leiden University) and Dr. A. Diaconescu (ETH Zurich) 
          and is partly funded by the CRC and the DFG.</p>
