        <h2>Effort-Reward Trade-offs</h2>
        <p> Every day life requires that we balance effort and reward. While some situations 
          call for habitual response, others require us to engage in goal-directed behaviour. 
          Importantly, our ability and willingness to balance these different types of behaviour 
          differs from person to person. In this project, we are interested in how individual 
          differences affect how we balance the effort that people put into actions against the 
          potential benefits they reap from performing these actions. </p>

        <h2>Cognitive Control and Cognitive Effort </h2>
        <p> Humans' abilities to control and direct our thoughts, to engage in planned, effortful, 
          behaviour, and to inhibit habitual response, can be collectively referred to as <strong>cognitive 
          control</strong>. When we are children, we are generally not very good at it. As we get older, we 
          become better and better at engaging our cognitive control, until we reach old age where it becomes 
          difficult again</p>
