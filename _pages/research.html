        <h2>Prevalence-Induced Concept Change </h2>
        <p> In this study we're interested in exploring how people make judgements about categories. Where do people 
          draw the line between categories like blue and purple, or what's more, between good and bad? How do these 
          categories change as we age and how are they affected by an ever-changing world?</p>

        <h2>Age differences in decision-making strategies </h2>
        <p> In this study we are interested in studying how young adults and old adults engage in 
          different decision-making strategies. Why do older adults rely more strongly on a habitual 
          decision-making strategy than younger adults do? What is the neural mechanism supporting this 
          shift towards habitual decision-making?</p>

        <h2>Cost benefit analysis in cognitive control</h2>
        <p> Every day life requires that we balance effort and reward. While some situations 
          call for habitual response, others require us to engage in goal-directed behaviour. 
          In this project, we are interested in how individual differences affect how we balance the effort 
          that people put into actions against the potential benefits they reap from performing these actions. </p>

        <h2>Lifespan age differences in meta control</h2>
        <p> Our findings suggest that aging affects the metacontrol of decision-making strategies 
          and that reduced model-based strategies in older adults are due to limited cognitive abilities</p>

        <h2>Observational Learning </h2>
        <p> Learning from social information shapes our cognitive development. As humans, we learn from otherâ€™s actions and outcomes. 
          In this study, we are interested in whether children and young adults differ in their ability to learn from observed feedback 
          and whether there are neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these differences.</p>
