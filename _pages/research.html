<h3>Effort-Reward Trade-Off</h3>

<br>
</center>
<p>Every day life requires that we balance effort and reward. While some situations call for habitual response, others require us
to engage in goal-directed behaviour. Importantly, our ability and willingness to balance these different types of behaviour 
differs from person to person. In this project, we are interested in how individual differences affect how we balance the 
effort that people put into actions against the potential benefits they reap from performing these actions. </p>

<h3>The Learning of Latent States</h3>

<p>Imagine that you are going to your favourite Italian restaurant for dinner. You go there often and always remember the food to be good.
Of course, some days the food is better than other and you normally just chalk this up to the chef's mood. But one day, you order your favourite
spaghetti dish, you take a bite, and spit it out! It's inedible! Quickly, you start to think that something much more drastic than 
a change in the chef's mood must have happened.</p>
<p>What you've done here is estimate the <u>latent state</u> (the overall quality of the food) from specific instances. Each meal you ordered
  helped inform your overall representation of the restaurant's food. But, when a big and unexpected change occured (eating the bad spaghetti),
  you quickly shifted your representation.</p>
<p>In this project, we are interested if and how different people represent these latent states and how it affects their behaviour.</p>

  <h3>Cognitive Control and Cognitive Effort </h3>
  <br>

  <br>
</center>
<p>Humans' abilities to control and direct our thoughts, to engage in planned, effortful, behaviour, and to inhibit habitual response, can be collectively referred to as cognitive control.
For example, in most parts of Canada it is perfectly fine to turn right on a red light if no traffic is coming. However, on the island of Montreal this is illegal. 
So for people who have just moved here, they must suppress their automatic "gut-feeling" tendency to turn right on a red light and engage in plan ahead to stop.
<br><br>
Our ability to engage in cognitive control changes as we age. When we are children, we are generally not very good at it. As we get older, we become better and better 
at engaging our cognitive control, until we reach old age where it becomes difficult again. Why does this happen? What factors explain this U-shape function?
Can cognitive control be improved into old age? 
<br><br>
In this study we explore how children and older adults differ from younger adults in balancing cognitive effort and if these differences
  can help explain why these groups have more difficulty engaging in cognitive control. </p>
