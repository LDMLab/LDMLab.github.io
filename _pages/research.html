        <h2>Effort-Reward Trade-offs</h2>
        <p> Every day life requires that we balance effort and reward. While some situations 
          call for habitual response, others require us to engage in goal-directed behaviour. 
          Importantly, our ability and willingness to balance these different types of behaviour 
          differs from person to person. In this project, we are interested in how individual 
          differences affect how we balance the effort that people put into actions against the 
          potential benefits they reap from performing these actions. </p>

        <h2>Cognitive Control and Cognitive Effort </h2>
        <p> Humans' abilities to control and direct our thoughts, to engage in planned, effortful, 
          behaviour, and to inhibit habitual response, can be collectively referred to as <strong>cognitive 
          control</strong>. When we are children, we are generally not very good at it. As we get older, we 
          become better and better at engaging our cognitive control, until we reach old age where it becomes 
          difficult again</p>

        <h2>Age differences in model-based decision-making </h2>
        <p> In this study we are interested in studying how young adults and old adults engage in 
          different decision-making strategies. Why do older adults rely more strongly on a habitual 
          decision-making strategy than younger adults do? What is the neural mechanism supporting this 
          shift towards habitual decision-making?</p>

        <h2>Prevalence-Induced Concept Change </h2>
        <p> In this study we're interested in exploring how people make judgements about categories. Where do people 
          draw the line between categories like blue and purple, or what's more, between good and bad? How do these 
          categories change as we age and how are they affected by an ever-changing world?</p>
