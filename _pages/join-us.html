 <h2>Honour's/Specialization Projects and Student Volunteers </h2>
    <p>We are always interested in hearing from undergraduate students seeking to complete an Honour's or Specialization project
    within our lab. If you don't have a project in mind, we recommend you check out our <a href="https://ldmlab.github.io/research/">
    active research projects</a> to learn more about what is going on in the lab. If you have another project you'd like to 
    undertake, we are always open to new suggestions!<br>
    For all inquiries, please email <a href = "mailto::ben.eppinger@concordia.ca">Dr. Ben Eppinger</a>
    with your name, CV, and a short description of what you'd like to do with our lab. If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask!</p>
