How do children and young adult differ in how they learn? How does this learning change in old age? What factors contribute to optimal decision-making strategies? 
<br><br>
The primary goal of our research is to gain a better understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying changes in learning and decision-making across the human lifespan. 
<br><br>
The LDM lab, directed by Dr. Ben Eppinger, studies how age affects learning mechanisms and decision-making strategies. 

<br><br>
Some of our research questions include:
<br><br>
A) What are the neuro-computational mechanisms underlying learning in uncertain environments and how do these learning processes develop across the human lifespan?
<br>
B) How does the ability to select and arbitrate between different learning strategies change as a function of age? 
<br>
C) How do humans learn from the behavior of other individuals and how does this ability change during lifespan development?
